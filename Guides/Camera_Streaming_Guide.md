# MAX78000 Camera Streaming using DMA



## Overview

Capturing and storing QVGA (320×240) or VGA (640×480) images requires a significant amount of memory beyond the internal memory of MAX78000. To solve this issue, camera streaming mode with Direct Memory Access (DMA) can be used to capture large images and transfer them line-by-line into MAX78000 memory for further processing in the Neural Network Accelerator, or for display on the TFT.

## Camera Settings

To activate the camera DMA streaming mode, use the `STREAMING_DMA` argument of the `camera_setup()` function. A code example for initializing the camera is shown below:

```c++
 int ret = 0;
 int slaveAddress;
 int id; 
 int dma_channel;

 // Initialize DMA for camera interface.
 MXC_DMA_Init();
 dma_channel = MXC_DMA_AcquireChannel(); 

 // Initialize the camera driver.
 camera_init(CAMERA_FREQ);

 // Obtain the I2C slave address of the camera.
 slaveAddress = camera_get_slave_address();
 PR_DEBUG("Camera I2C slave address is %02x\n", slaveAddress);

 // Obtain the product ID of the camera.
 ret = camera_get_product_id(&id);

 if (ret != STATUS_OK) {
     PR_ERR("Error returned from reading camera id. Error %d\n", ret);
     return -1;
 }

 PR_DEBUG("Camera Product ID is %04x\n", id);

 // Obtain the manufacturer ID of the camera.
 ret = camera_get_manufacture_id(&id);

 if (ret != STATUS_OK) {
     PR_ERR("Error returned from reading camera id. Error %d\n", ret);
     return -1;
 }

 PR_DEBUG("Camera Manufacturer ID is %04x\n", id);

 // Setup camera image dimensions, pixel format and data acquiring details.
 ret = camera_setup(IMAGE_XRES, IMAGE_YRES, PIXFORMAT_RGB565, FIFO_FOUR_BYTE, STREAMING_DMA, dma_channel); // RGB565 stream

 if (ret != STATUS_OK) {
     PR_ERR("Error returned from setting up camera. Error %d\n", ret);
     return -1;
 }
 // If needed, reduce transfer speed by setting the camera internal
 // clock pre-scaler value=0x0-0x1F.
 camera_write_reg(0x11, 0x1);
```



## Camera DMA Streaming API

DMA automatically transfers captured images from the PCIF RX FIFO into two streaming double (“ping-pong”) buffers, each sized to match the image width and allocated in memory. While one buffer is being accessed by the DMA, the second buffer can be consumed by the application (CNN process, TFT display). The application needs to get a pointer to the available streaming buffer by calling `get_camera_stream_buffer()` and wait until it is not `NULL`. After consuming the data, the application must release the streaming buffer for the next DMA transaction by calling the `release_camera_stream_buffer()`function. Also, the application can monitor the number of DMA transfers (image height) per image as well as an overflow condition.

```c++
typedef struct _stream_stat {
    uint32_t dma_transfer_count;
    uint32_t overflow_count;
} stream_stat_t;

// Get camera streaming buffer.
uint8_t* get_camera_stream_buffer(void);

// Release camera streaming buffer.
void release_camera_stream_buffer(void);

// Get statistics of DMA streaming mode.
stream_stat_t* get_camera_stream_statistic(void);
```

The overflow condition is detected when `overflow_count` is not zero. It may happen if the processing of the image by the application is slower pace than the image capture. To match the image capture and processing speeds, increase the camera clock pre-scale value: *camera_write_reg(0x11, **0x1**)*. This value can be set in the range from 0x0 to 0x1F inclusively. Reducing the clock pre-scale value slows the camera output clock and reduces the image capture speed.

## Streaming an Image to the CNN

The CNN model must be  synthesized with the `--fifo` or `--fast-fifo` options in ai8xize.py.

The `cnn_start()` function should be called first, followed by `camera_start_capture_image()` to capture  an image.

The CNN will start processing data automatically when enough data is available.

Loading image data to the CNN is done in a time-critical nested loop by writing image horizontal lines one by one into the CNN FIFO.

It is important to check `stat->dma_transfer_count` to make sure there is no overflow of streaming buffers. If an overflow condition is detected, increase the camera clock pre-scale value as described above.

```c++
uint32_t cnn_unload_buffer[CNN_NUM_OUTPUTS/4];
uint32_t imgLen;
uint32_t width, height;
uint8_t* data = NULL;
uint8_t* data_ptr;

// Get the details of the image from the camera driver.
camera_get_image(&data, &imgLen, &width, &height);
// Enable CNN clock
MXC_SYS_ClockEnable(MXC_SYS_PERIPH_CLOCK_CNN);
// Start CNN
cnn_start();
// Capture image
camera_start_capture_image();

// Load captured image to CNN memory
for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) {
  // Wait until camera streaming buffer is full
  while((data = get_camera_stream_buffer()) == NULL) {
    if (camera_is_image_rcv())
      break;
  }

  data_ptr = data;
      // Load image horizontal line
  for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {
    uint8_t ur, ug, ub;
    // Extract colors from RGB565 and convert to signed value
    ur = (*data_ptr & 0xF8) ^ 0x80; 
    ug = ((*data_ptr << 5) | ((*(data_ptr+1) & 0xE0) >> 3)) ^ 0x80;
    ub = (*(data_ptr+1) << 3) ^ 0x80;
    // Next pixel
    data_ptr += 2;
    // Wait for FIFO 0
    while (((*((volatile uint32_t*) 0x50000004) & 1)) != 0);  
    // Loading data into the CNN fifo in HWC format
    *((volatile uint32_t*) 0x50000008) = 0x00FFFFFF & ((ub << 16) | (ug << 8) | ur);
  }
  
  // Optional: Draw one horizontal line of captured image on TFT
  // It increases latency and may require reducing image capture speed 
  MXC_TFT_ShowImageCameraRGB565(X_START, Y_START + i, data, width, 1);
     
  // Release streaming buffer
  release_camera_stream_buffer();
}

stream_stat_t* stat = get_camera_stream_statistic();
PR_DEBUG("DMA transfer count = %d", stat->dma_transfer_count);
// Check overflow condition
PR_DEBUG("OVERFLOW = %d", stat->overflow_count);
    
// Wait when image is fully captured
while(camera_is_image_rcv() == 0);

// Wait for CNN done
while (cnn_time == 0) {
  __WFI();    
}
    
// Unload CNN result
cnn_unload(cnn_unload_buffer);
// Stop CNN
cnn_stop();

// Disable CNN clock to save power
MXC_SYS_ClockDisable(MXC_SYS_PERIPH_CLOCK_CNN);
```
